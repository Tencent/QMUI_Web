This framework consists of a collection of SASS methods and a built-in workflow, which can help you easily improve the efficiency, maintainability and robustness of your web UI development. Especially, when you want to adjust appearance of your website globally or deal with frequent UI design alteration, QMUI Web will be your best choice.

## Features

### Components and Configuration
You can easily adjust global appearance of basic built-in components by editing a SASS config file. （[How do QMUI config file and basic components contribute to your UI development?](https://github.com/Tencent/QMUI_Web/wiki/Q&A#qmui-sass-%E9%85%8D%E7%BD%AE%E8%A1%A8%E5%92%8C%E5%85%AC%E5%85%B1%E7%BB%84%E4%BB%B6%E5%A6%82%E4%BD%95%E5%B8%AE%E5%BF%99%E5%BC%80%E5%8F%91%E8%80%85%E5%BF%AB%E9%80%9F%E6%90%AD%E5%BB%BA%E9%A1%B9%E7%9B%AE%E5%9F%BA%E7%A1%80-ui)）

### SASS Enhancement
QMUI Web ships with more than 70 SASS Mixin, Function and Extend, dealing with layout, appearance, animation, device adaptation, math calculation and other SASS enhancement, which will make your development faster and easier.
### Automatic Processing
QMUI Web has a built-in workflow and tools to automate a lot of work, including the Sprite image, html template engine, image management and compression, static resource merging and compression, and redundant file cleanup.

### Extended Component
In addition to the built-in basic components, we also provide several extended components such as file upload button, tree menu, etc.

## Setup

```bash
#Install Yeoman. If you have already installed, please ignore this step.
npm install -g yo
#Install QMUI Template

## QMUI Web Desktop

If you prefer visual interface rather than CLI, it is recommended to try an additional desktop application: [QMUI Web Desktop](https://github.com/Tencent/QMUI_Web_desktop). You can manage projects based on QMUI Web, toggle QMUI Web services, and get compilation or error message in time through it.
